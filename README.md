# Bank-Loan-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a loan dataset to uncover patterns in loan applications, funding, and repayment behaviors. The analysis focuses on identifying differences between good loans (fully paid or current) and bad loans (charged off), while also exploring the impact of borrower characteristics such as employment length, home ownership, loan purpose, and state of residence.


# Tools & Libraries

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

* Jupyter Notebook


# Visualizations

* Line charts for monthly applications.

* Bar charts for loan terms and employment lengths.

* Pie/treemap charts for loan purpose.


# Exploratory Data Analysis

* Total Loan applications, total funded amount, total recieved amount, average interest rate, average Dti
* Good Loan vs Bad Loan:
     The dataset shows a clear dominance of good loans, with 33,243 applications (86.18%) totaling $370.22M funded and $435.79M received. In contrast, bad loans accounted for only 5,333 applications (13.82%), with $65.53M funded but only $37.28M received, highlighting the risk gap between fully paid and defaulted loans.
